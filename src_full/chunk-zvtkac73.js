Named-product examples:
- "check my Asana tasks" \u2192 keywords ["asana", "tasks", "todo"]
- "find issues in Jira" \u2192 keywords ["jira", "issues"]

Intent-based examples (no product named):
- "help me manage my tasks" \u2192 keywords ["tasks", "todo", "project management"]
- "pull up the design mockups" \u2192 keywords ["design", "figma", "mockup"]

Returns a ranked list with directoryUuid, name, description, sample tool names, installState (org-level), and enabledInChat (this session). Results include the org's custom connectors (ones the org configured that are not in the public directory) when they match the keywords. enabledInChat: false with installState: "connected" means the connector is authenticated but toggled off for this chat \u2014 its tools are not in your tool list; tell the user to enable it in this chat's connector settings. If a result looks relevant and is not installed, tell the user they could connect it via claude.ai; this tool does not itself connect anything.`;
