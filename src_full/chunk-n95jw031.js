ONLY call this tool when the user has explicitly opted into multi-agent orchestration. Workflows can spawn dozens of agents and consume a large amount of tokens; the user must request that scale, not have it inferred. Explicit opt-in means one of:
- The user included the keyword "ultracode" in their prompt (you'll see a system-reminder confirming it).
- Ultracode is on for the session (a system-reminder confirms it) \u2014 see **Ultracode** in the workflow authoring reference.
- The user directly asked you to run a workflow or use multi-agent orchestration in their own words ("use a workflow", "run a workflow", "fan out agents", "orchestrate this with subagents"). The ask must be in the user's words \u2014 a task that would merely benefit from a workflow does not count.
- The user invoked a skill or slash command whose instructions tell you to call Workflow.
- The user asked you to run a specific named or saved workflow.

For any other task \u2014 even one that would clearly benefit from parallelism \u2014 do NOT call this tool. Use the ${_t} tool (if available) for individual subagents, or briefly describe what a multi-agent workflow could do and how much it would roughly cost, and ask the user whether to run it. Mention they can ask for one with "use a workflow" in a future message to skip the ask.

Every script must begin with \`export const meta = {...}\`: a PURE LITERAL (no variables, calls or interpolation) giving the workflow's \`name\`, a one-line \`description\` (shown in the permission dialog) and optionally \`phases\` \u2014 one \`{ title, detail? }\` per phase() call, titles matched exactly. Pass the script inline via \`script\` \u2014 do not Write it to a file first, and do not also set the tool's \`name\` input (that selects a saved workflow); it is plain JavaScript, not TypeScript.

The canonical multi-stage pattern \u2014 pipeline by default, each dimension verifies as soon as its review completes:
  export const meta = {
    name: 'review-changes',
    description: 'Review changed files across dimensions, verify each finding',
    phases: [{ title: 'Review' }, { title: 'Verify' }],
  }
  const DIMENSIONS = [{key: 'bugs', prompt: '...'}, {key: 'perf', prompt: '...'}]
  const results = await pipeline(
    DIMENSIONS,
    d => agent(d.prompt, {label: \`review:\${d.key}\`, phase: 'Review', schema: FINDINGS_SCHEMA}),
    review => parallel(review.findings.map(f => () =>
      agent(\`Adversarially verify: \${f.title}\`, {label: \`verify:\${f.file}\`, phase: 'Verify', schema: VERDICT_SCHEMA})
        .then(v => ({...f, verdict: v}))
    ))
  )
  const confirmed = results.flat().filter(Boolean).filter(f => f.verdict?.isReal)
  return { confirmed }
  // Dimension 'bugs' findings verify while dimension 'perf' is still reviewing. No wasted wall-clock.`;

A workflow structures work across many agents \u2014 to be comprehensive (decompose and cover in parallel), to be confident (independent perspectives and adversarial checks before committing), or to take on scale one context can't hold (migrations, audits, broad sweeps). The script is where you encode that structure: what fans out, what verifies, what synthesizes.

When you do call it, the right move is often **hybrid**: scout inline first (list the files, find the channels, scope the diff) to discover the work-list, then call Workflow to pipeline over it. You don't need to know the shape before the *task* \u2014 only before the *orchestration step*.

Common single-phase workflows you can chain across turns:
- **Understand** \u2014 parallel readers over relevant subsystems \u2192 structured map
- **Design** \u2014 judge panel of N independent approaches \u2192 scored synthesis
- **Review** \u2014 dimensions \u2192 find \u2192 adversarially verify (the review-changes example)
- **Research** \u2014 multi-modal sweep \u2192 deep-read \u2192 synthesize
- **Migrate** \u2014 discover sites \u2192 transform each (worktree isolation) \u2192 verify

For larger work, run several in sequence \u2014 read each result before deciding the next phase. You stay in the loop; each workflow is one well-scoped fan-out.

**Ultracode.** When a system-reminder confirms ultracode is on, that opt-in is standing: author and run a workflow for every substantive task by default. The goal is the most exhaustive, correct answer you can produce \u2014 token cost is not a constraint. For multi-phase work (understand \u2192 design \u2192 implement \u2192 review), that often means several workflows in sequence \u2014 one per phase \u2014 so you stay in the loop between them. The quality patterns below (adversarial verify, multi-modal sweep, completeness critic, loop-until-dry) are the tools; pick what fits the task. Lean toward orchestrating with workflows and adversarially verifying your findings \u2014 unless the work is trivial or already verified. Solo only on conversational turns or trivial mechanical edits. When a reminder says ultracode is off, revert to the opt-in rule in the Workflow tool description.

Pass the script inline via \`script\` \u2014 do not Write it to a file first. Every${o} invocation automatically persists its script to a file under the session directory and returns the path in the tool result. To iterate on a workflow, edit that file with Write/Edit and re-invoke Workflow with \`{scriptPath: "<path>"}\` instead of resending the full script.${s}

Every script must begin with \`export const meta = {...}\`:
  export const meta = {
    name: 'find-flaky-tests',
    description: 'Find flaky tests and propose fixes',   // one-line, shown in permission dialog
    phases: [                                            // one entry per phase() call
      { title: 'Scan', detail: 'grep test logs for retries' },
      { title: 'Fix', detail: 'one agent per flaky test' },
    ],
  }
  // script body starts here \u2014 use agent()/parallel()/pipeline()/phase()/log()
  phase('Scan')
  const flaky = await agent('grep CI logs for retry markers', {schema: FLAKY_SCHEMA})
  ...

The \`meta\` object must be a PURE LITERAL \u2014 no variables, function calls, spreads, or template interpolation. Required fields: \`name\`, \`description\`. Optional: \`whenToUse\` (shown in the workflow list), \`phases\`. Use the SAME phase titles in meta.phases as in phase() calls \u2014 titles are matched exactly; a phase() call with no matching meta entry just gets its own progress group.${e ? "" : " Add `model` to a phase entry when that phase uses a specific model override."}

Script body hooks:
- agent(prompt: string, opts?: {label?: string, phase?: string, schema?: object,${e ? "" : " model?: string,"} effort?: string, isolation?: ${r}, agentType?: string}): Promise<any> \u2014 spawn a subagent. Without schema, returns its final text as a string. With schema (a JSON Schema), the subagent is forced to call a StructuredOutput tool and agent() returns the validated object \u2014 no parsing needed. Returns null if the user skips the agent mid-run or the subagent dies on a terminal API error after retries (filter with .filter(Boolean)). opts.label overrides the display label. opts.phase explicitly assigns this agent to a progress group (use this inside pipeline()/parallel() stages to avoid races on the global phase() state \u2014 same phase string \u2192 same group box).${e ? "" : " opts.model overrides the model for this agent call. Default to omitting it \u2014 the agent inherits the main-loop model (the resolved session model), which is almost always correct. Only set it when you're highly confident a different tier fits the task; when unsure, omit."} opts.effort overrides the reasoning effort for this agent call ('low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh' | 'max') \u2014 omit to inherit the session effort; use 'low' for cheap mechanical stages and higher tiers only for the hardest verify/judge stages. opts.isolation: 'worktree' runs the agent in a fresh git worktree \u2014 EXPENSIVE (~200-500ms setup + disk per agent), use ONLY when agents mutate files in parallel and would otherwise conflict; the worktree is auto-removed if unchanged.${n} opts.agentType uses a custom subagent type (e.g. 'general-purpose', 'code-reviewer') instead of the default workflow subagent \u2014 resolved from the same registry as the Agent tool; composes with schema (the custom agent's system prompt gets a StructuredOutput instruction appended).
- pipeline(items, stage1, stage2, ...): Promise<any[]> \u2014 run each item through all stages independently, NO barrier between stages. Item A can be in stage 3 while item B is still in stage 1. This is the DEFAULT for multi-stage work. Wall-clock = slowest single-item chain, not sum-of-slowest-per-stage. Every stage callback receives (prevResult, originalItem, index) \u2014 use originalItem/index in later stages to label work without threading context through stage 1's return value. A stage that throws drops that item to \`null\` and skips its remaining stages.
- parallel(thunks: Array<() => Promise<any>>): Promise<any[]> \u2014 run tasks concurrently. This is a BARRIER: awaits all thunks before returning. A thunk that throws (or whose agent errors) resolves to \`null\` in the result array \u2014 the call itself never rejects, so \`.filter(Boolean)\` before using the results. Use ONLY when you genuinely need all results together.
- log(message: string): void \u2014 emit a progress message to the user (shown as a narrator line above the progress tree)
- phase(title: string): void \u2014 start a new phase; subsequent agent() calls are grouped under this title in the progress display
- args: any \u2014 the value passed as Workflow's \`args\` input, verbatim (undefined if not provided). Pass arrays/objects as actual JSON values in the tool call, NOT as a JSON-encoded string \u2014 \`args: ["a.ts", "b.ts"]\`, not \`args: "[\\"a.ts\\", ...]"\` (a stringified list reaches the script as one string, so \`args.filter\`/\`args.map\` throw). Use this to parameterize named workflows \u2014 e.g. pass a research question, target path, or config object directly instead of via a side-channel file.
- budget: {total: number|null, spent(): number, remaining(): number} \u2014 the turn's token target from the user's "+500k"-style directive. \`budget.total\` is null if no target was set. \`budget.spent()\` returns output tokens spent this turn across the main loop and all workflows \u2014 the pool is shared, not per-workflow. \`budget.remaining()\` returns \`max(0, total - spent())\`, or \`Infinity\` if no target. The target is a HARD ceiling, not advisory: once \`spent()\` reaches \`total\`, further \`agent()\` calls throw. Use for dynamic loops: \`while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000) { ... }\`, or static scaling: \`const FLEET = budget.total ? Math.floor(budget.total / 100_000) : 5\`.
- workflow(nameOrRef: string | {scriptPath: string}, args?: any): Promise<any> \u2014 run another workflow inline as a sub-step and return whatever it returns. Pass a name to invoke a saved workflow (same registry as {name: "..."}), or {scriptPath} to run a script file you Wrote earlier. The child shares this run's concurrency cap, agent counter, abort signal, and token budget \u2014 its agents appear under a "${OCe} name" group in /workflows and its tokens count toward budget.spent(). The args param becomes the child's \`args\` global. Nesting is one level only: workflow() inside a child throws. Throws on unknown name / unreadable scriptPath / child syntax error; catch to handle gracefully.

Subagents are told their final text IS the return value (not a human-facing message), so they return raw data. For structured output, use the schema option \u2014 validation happens at the tool-call layer so the model retries on mismatch.

Workflow agents can reach all session-connected MCP tools via ToolSearch \u2014 schemas load on demand per agent. Caveat: interactively-authenticated MCP servers (e.g. claude.ai) may be absent in headless/cron runs.

Scripts are plain JavaScript, NOT TypeScript \u2014 type annotations (\`: string[]\`), interfaces, and generics fail to parse. The script body runs in an async context \u2014 use await directly. Standard JS built-ins (JSON, Math, Array, etc.) are available \u2014 EXCEPT \`Date.now()\`/\`Math.random()\`/argless \`new Date()\`, which throw (they would break resume); pass timestamps in via \`args\`, stamp results after the workflow returns, and for randomness vary the agent prompt/label by index. No filesystem or Node.js API access.

DEFAULT TO pipeline(). Only reach for a barrier (parallel between stages) when you genuinely need ALL prior-stage results together.

A barrier is correct ONLY when stage N needs cross-item context from all of stage N-1:
- Dedup/merge across the full result set before expensive downstream work
- Early-exit if the total count is zero ("0 bugs found \u2192 skip verification entirely")
- Stage N's prompt references "the other findings" for comparison

A barrier is NOT justified by:
- "I need to flatten/map/filter first" \u2014 do it inside a pipeline stage: pipeline(items, stageA, r => transform([r]).flat(), stageB)
- "The stages are conceptually separate" \u2014 that's what pipeline() models. Separate stages \u2260 synchronized stages.
- "It's cleaner code" \u2014 barrier latency is real. If 5 finders run and the slowest takes 3\xD7 the fastest, a barrier wastes 2/3 of the fast finders' idle time.

Smell test: if you wrote
  const a = await parallel(...)
  const b = transform(a)        // flatten, map, filter \u2014 no cross-item dependency
  const c = await parallel(b.map(...))
that middle transform doesn't need the barrier. Rewrite as a pipeline with the transform inside a stage. When in doubt: pipeline.

Concurrent agent() calls are capped at min(16, available CPUs - 2) per workflow \u2014 excess calls queue and run as slots free up. You can still pass 100 items to parallel()/pipeline() and they all complete; only ~10 run at any moment. Total agent count across a workflow's lifetime is capped at 1000 \u2014 a runaway-loop backstop set far above any real workflow. A single parallel()/pipeline() call accepts at most ${U_} items; passing more is an explicit error, not a silent truncation.

When a barrier IS correct \u2014 dedup across all findings before expensive verification:
  const all = await parallel(DIMENSIONS.map(d => () => agent(d.prompt, {schema: FINDINGS_SCHEMA})))
  const deduped = dedupeByFileAndLine(all.filter(Boolean).flatMap(r => r.findings))  // <-- genuinely needs ALL at once
  const verified = await parallel(deduped.map(f => () => agent(verifyPrompt(f), {schema: VERDICT_SCHEMA})))

Loop-until-count pattern \u2014 accumulate to a target:
  const bugs = []
  while (bugs.length < 10) {
    const result = await agent("Find bugs in this codebase.", {schema: BUGS_SCHEMA})
    bugs.push(...result.bugs)
    log(\`\${bugs.length}/10 found\`)
  }

Loop-until-budget pattern \u2014 scale depth to the user's "+500k" directive. Guard on budget.total: with no target set, remaining() is Infinity and the loop would run straight to the 1000-agent cap.
  const bugs = []
  while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000) {
    const result = await agent("Find bugs in this codebase.", {schema: BUGS_SCHEMA})
    bugs.push(...result.bugs)
    log(\`\${bugs.length} found, \${Math.round(budget.remaining()/1000)}k remaining\`)
  }

Composing patterns \u2014 exhaustive review (find \u2192 dedup vs seen \u2192 diverse-lens panel \u2192 loop-until-dry):
  const seen = new Set(), confirmed = []
  let dry = 0
  while (dry < 2) {                                              // loop-until-dry
    const found = (await parallel(FINDERS.map(f => () =>          // barrier: collect all finders this round
      agent(f.prompt, {phase: 'Find', schema: BUGS})))).filter(Boolean).flatMap(r => r.bugs)
    const fresh = found.filter(b => !seen.has(key(b)))           // dedup vs ALL seen \u2014 plain code, not an agent
    if (!fresh.length) { dry++; continue }
    dry = 0; fresh.forEach(b => seen.add(key(b)))
    const judged = await parallel(fresh.map(b => () =>           // every fresh bug judged concurrently...
      parallel(['correctness','security','repro'].map(lens => () =>   // ...each by 3 distinct lenses
        agent(\`Judge "\${b.desc}" via the \${lens} lens \u2014 real?\`, {phase: 'Verify', schema: VERDICT})))
        .then(vs => ({ b, real: vs.filter(Boolean).filter(v => v.real).length >= 2 }))))
    confirmed.push(...judged.filter(v => v.real).map(v => v.b))
  }
  return confirmed
  // dedup vs \`seen\`, NOT \`confirmed\` \u2014 else judge-rejected findings reappear every round and it never converges.

Quality patterns \u2014 common shapes; pick by task and compose freely:
- Adversarial verify: spawn N independent skeptics per finding, each prompted to REFUTE. Kill if \u2265majority refute. Prevents plausible-but-wrong findings from surviving.
    const votes = await parallel(Array.from({length: 3}, () => () =>
      agent(\`Try to refute: \${claim}. Default to refuted=true if uncertain.\`, {schema: VERDICT})))
    const survives = votes.filter(Boolean).filter(v => !v.refuted).length >= 2
- Perspective-diverse verify: when a finding can fail in more than one way, give each verifier a distinct lens (correctness, security, perf, does-it-reproduce) instead of N identical refuters \u2014 diversity catches failure modes redundancy can't.
- Judge panel: generate N independent attempts from different angles (e.g. MVP-first, risk-first, user-first), score with parallel judges, synthesize from the winner while grafting the best ideas from runners-up. Beats one-attempt-iterated when the solution space is wide.
- Loop-until-dry: for unknown-size discovery (bugs, issues, edge cases), keep spawning finders until K consecutive rounds return nothing new. Simple counters (while count < N) miss the tail.
- Multi-modal sweep: parallel agents each searching a different way (by-container, by-content, by-entity, by-time). Each is blind to what the others surface; useful when one search angle won't find everything.
- Completeness critic: a final agent that asks "what's missing \u2014 modality not run, claim unverified, source unread?" What it finds becomes the next round of work.
- No silent caps: if a workflow bounds coverage (top-N, no-retry, sampling), \`log()\` what was dropped \u2014 silent truncation reads as "covered everything" when it didn't.

Scale to what the user asked for. "find any bugs" \u2192 a few finders, single-vote verify. "thoroughly audit this" or "be comprehensive" \u2192 larger finder pool, 3\u20135 vote adversarial pass, synthesis stage. When unsure, lean toward thoroughness for research/review/audit requests and toward brevity for quick checks.

These patterns aren't exhaustive \u2014 compose novel harnesses when the task calls for it (tournament brackets, self-repair loops, staged escalation, whatever fits).

Use this tool for multi-step orchestration where control flow should be deterministic (loops, conditionals, fan-out) rather than model-driven.

## Resume

The tool result includes a runId. To resume after a pause, kill, or script edit, relaunch with Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId}) \u2014 the longest unchanged prefix of agent() calls returns cached results instantly; the first edited/new call and everything after it runs live. Same script + same args \u2192 100% cache hit. Before diagnosing why a completed workflow returned an empty or unexpected result, Read <transcriptDir>/journal.jsonl \u2014 it records each agent's actual return value; do not assume cached results are non-empty. Date.now()/Math.random()/new Date() are unavailable in scripts (they would break this) \u2014 stamp results after the workflow returns, or pass timestamps via args. Fallback when no journal is available: Read agent-<id>.jsonl files in the transcript directory and hand-author a continuation script.`;
